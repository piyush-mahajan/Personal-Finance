## Getting Started

To run the Expense Tracker locally, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/expense-tracker.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd expense-tracker`
4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Enter the title and cost of a product in the provided input fields.
2. Click the "Add" button to add the expense to the list and update the total expenses.
3. To edit or delete an expense, use the corresponding buttons in the expense list.

## Architecture Flow

The Expense Tracker follows a client-side architecture, where the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files work together to provide the functionality and user interface.

1. When the user opens the Expense Tracker in a web browser, the `index.html` file is loaded first. This file serves as the entry point of the application and provides the overall structure of the webpage.

2. The HTML file references the `style.css` file using a `<link>` tag. The CSS file contains styles and layout rules that define the visual appearance of the Expense Tracker. It ensures a consistent and modern UI design.

3. The HTML file also references the `script.js` file using a `<script>` tag. The JavaScript file contains the logic and functionality of the Expense Tracker.

4. Upon loading the `script.js` file, it starts executing the code. It interacts with the HTML elements using the Document Object Model (DOM) API to handle user inputs and perform necessary calculations and updates.

5. When the user enters the title and cost of a product and clicks the "Add" button, the JavaScript code captures the input values, validates them, and updates the total expenses accordingly. It also adds the entered expense to the expense list dynamically.

6. The JavaScript code utilizes event listeners to listen for user interactions and trigger appropriate functions or actions. It also makes use of functions and variables to organize and structure the code, ensuring modularity and reusability.

7. The `script.js` file may make use of additional helper functions or external libraries to enhance the functionality of the Expense Tracker, such as handling data persistence or providing advanced features.

8. The user can edit or delete expenses from the expense list using the corresponding buttons. The JavaScript code handles these actions, updates the total expenses, and modifies the expense list accordingly.

9. Throughout the process, the CSS styles defined in the `style.css` file are applied to the HTML elements, creating an aesthetically pleasing and responsive user interface.

10. The user can interact with the Expense Tracker, adding, editing, or deleting expenses as needed. The application provides real-time updates and a smooth user experience.

This architectural flow ensures a seamless integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a functional and visually appealing Expense Tracker.

## Usage of GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot, powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model, is an AI-powered coding assistant that provides code suggestions and auto-completions directly within the code editor. It can assist developers in writing code more efficiently and effectively. In the Expense Tracker project, GitHub Copilot can be utilized in various scenarios:

### 1. Generating HTML and CSS Boilerplate

When starting a new HTML or CSS file, GitHub Copilot can generate the initial structure and basic elements for you. It can provide suggestions for common HTML tags, CSS classes, and styles, allowing you to quickly set up the foundation of your web page.

### 2. Autocompleting HTML Tags and Attributes

As you write HTML code, GitHub Copilot can suggest closing tags, attribute names, and attribute values based on context. It saves time by automatically completing the code you're typing and reducing the chances of typos or syntax errors.

### 3. Providing JavaScript Function Templates

When writing JavaScript code for event handling or other functionalities, GitHub Copilot can provide function templates and suggest relevant method calls or code snippets. It helps in quickly implementing common functionality, such as handling form submissions or updating the UI based on user actions.

### 4. Offering Code Examples and Best Practices

GitHub Copilot can suggest code examples and best practices for specific tasks or challenges you encounter while developing the Expense Tracker. It can provide insights on how to structure your code, use design patterns, or implement efficient algorithms.

### 5. Assisting in Debugging and Troubleshooting

When encountering errors or bugs in your code, GitHub Copilot can assist in troubleshooting by suggesting possible solutions based on the error message or code context. It can help in identifying and fixing common programming mistakes, saving time and effort in the debugging process.

It's important to note that while GitHub Copilot provides useful code suggestions, it's always recommended to review and validate the suggested code snippets to ensure they align with your project requirements and follow best coding practices.
